javaAppExampleReadJsonExtFile. For personal use as Example of reading external JSONs

The application is only for personal use. I just created an example about how read JSON from external file.
Why
### Why?
Because I need sometimes to start an application and I don't have time to try again and again to find a solution.
Details

This is not a web appl. It is a java app which are running from command line.

### The name?
The name is comming from a test I got from a recruitor for PatientSky, which is a new company in Oslo. I didn't pass the test. But I have been working whith this and I liked and I have decided to keep the code for future inspiration.
